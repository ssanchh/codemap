      question: "Does my code leave my machine?",
      answer:
        "No, all analysis runs locally. RepoScope builds its dependency map on your machine, and GuardRails runs your tests locally. Your code never leaves your system.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this slow down Cursor?",
      answer:
        "Adds 1â€“2 ms. You won't feel it. RepoScope's indexing happens in the background, and GuardRails runs tests asynchronously without blocking your workflow.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does it work?",
      answer:
        "We index your repo locally, then augment prompts and test changes in real time. RepoScope builds a live dependency graph, while GuardRails monitors file changes and runs relevant tests automatically.",
    },
    {
      question: "What programming languages are supported?",
      answer:
        "We support all major languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, and more. Language-specific features are continuously being added.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this with GitHub Copilot?",
      answer:
        "Yes! While optimized for Cursor, RepoScope + GuardRails also works with GitHub Copilot, VSCode, and other AI coding assistants.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens during the beta?",
      answer:
        "Beta users get free access to all features, direct feedback channels with our team, and priority support. Your feedback helps shape the final product.",
